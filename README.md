A "Smart Video Assistant" that works completely on your computer (no internet needed)

Design and implement a fully local AI desktop application capable of analyzing and querying short video files (approximately 1 minute each). The application should extract and summarize content, generate reports (PDF/PPT), and operate entirely offline using local AI models and self-developed MCP servers.
