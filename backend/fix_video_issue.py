# MANUAL VIDEO CREATION GUIDE

## OPTION 1: Record with Phone (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open your phone's camera app
2. Switch to video mode
3. Record yourself saying this script clearly:

"Hello, this is a test video for the Smart Video Assistant. 
I am demonstrating the speech recognition capabilities.
The system uses Whisper AI to convert speech to text.
This test will validate the transcription accuracy.
Thank you for watching this demonstration."

4. Keep recording for about 30-60 seconds
5. Save the video
6. Transfer to your computer
7. Copy to: data/videos/my_speech_test.mp4

## OPTION 2: Use Windows Voice Recorder + Screen Recording
1. Open Windows Voice Recorder
2. Record the script above
3. Play the recording while using screen recording software
4. Save as MP4

## OPTION 3: Download from Free Sites
1. Visit: https://pixabay.com/videos/
2. Search for "speech" or "talking"
3. Download a short video with clear speech
4. Convert to MP4 if needed
5. Save to data/videos/ folder

## VERIFICATION STEPS
After getting your video:
1. Double-click the MP4 file
2. Verify it plays in Windows Media Player or VLC
3. Ensure you can hear clear speech
4. File should be 30-120 seconds long
5. Test with our Whisper script

## FILE REQUIREMENTS
‚úÖ Format: MP4
‚úÖ Duration: 30-120 seconds  
‚úÖ Audio: Clear human speech
‚úÖ Size: Under 50MB
‚úÖ Playable in standard media players
